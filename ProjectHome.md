For now, this project mainly includes a pure Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) model and a conditional RBM model.  I'll add a whole suite of other models (Factored RBM, SVD++, Time Dependent SVD++, Integrated Model, etc) if there is interest.

Kudos to Ehud Ben-Reuven for creating the base nprize code, available here:
